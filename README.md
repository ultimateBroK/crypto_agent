3. **AI Analysis Pipeline:**
   - Technical data is formatted into a comprehensive prompt for the Gemini AI model (`src/analytics/ai_analysis.py`)

   - AI responses are enhanced for clarity and confidence

4. **Advanced Visualization:**
   - Interactive candlestick charts with multiple timeframe options (`src/ui_components/charts.py`)
   - Support and resistance levels plotted directly on charts (`src/ui_components/price_targets.py`)
